# Hacker-Statistics
In this project I have used Hacker Statistics method of calculating the probability of climbing up above 60 floors of the Empire State Building.

Given we roll the Dice 100 times and that we are on the ground floor when we start.
We roll a Dice,
if outcome = 1,2
  take a step down,
 eise if outcome = 3,4,5
  take a step up,
 else if outcome = 6
  roll the dice again and take the number of steps up that comes up on the dice on the second throw after getting six
  
  we conduct this experiment several times to get last steps or the floor at which we reach finally after rolling the dice 100 times
  i.e dice is thrown 100 times in sets of several to get the final floor number after each set.
  
  To calculate probabilty of getting onto a floor greater than 60
  is the number of times reaching above 60th floor divided by total number of sets
  
  This experiment has to be done infinite times to get the theoretical probability
