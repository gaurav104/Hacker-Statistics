# Hacker-Statistics
In this project I have used Hacker Statistics method of calculating the probability of climbing up avobe 60 floors of the Empire State Building.

Given we roll the Dice 100 times and that we are on the ground floor 
We roll a Dice
if outcome = 1,2
  take a step down
 eise if outcome = 3,4,5
  take a step up
 else
  roll the dice again and take the number of steps up that comes up on the dice on the second through after getting six
  
  we conduct this experiment several times to get last steps or floor at which we get after rolling the dice 100 times
  i.e dice is thrown 100 times in sets of several to get the final floor after rolling the dice 100 times
  
  To calculate probabilty of getting onto a floor greater that 60
  is the number of times reaching above 60 floors divided by total number of experiments
  
  This experiment has to be done infinite times to get the theoretical probability
